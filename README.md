A school project creating a skin care fictional online store.

## Description
I designed and built this e-commerce skin care site. I designed the logo, shot and found images myself and on unsplash.com, and edited the images in Adobe Photoshop to make it look like a authentic skin care line. I used Strapi API to fetch the content/products to the site. The site also has an admin functionality to create, update or delete products.

## Built With
- Strapi
- Sass

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Running
To run the app, run the following command:
```
npm run develop
```
The admin panel will open at `http://localhost:1337/admin`.

If you get a warning about not being able to use port 1337, check that no other Strapi instances are running in another command line or terminal.
