# Semester Project 2

I was to make an online store. I wanted to make a skin care e-store.

## Description

## Built With
- Strapi
- Sass

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Running
To run the app, run the following command:

npm run develop

The admin panel will open at `http://localhost:1337/admin`.

If you get a warning about not being able to use port 1337, check that no other Strapi instances are running in another command line or terminal.
